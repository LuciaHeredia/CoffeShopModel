# UnityCoffeShop

The project contains a little neighborhod and a coffe shop.
The doors of each house open/close, same as the sliding doors of the coffe shop.
You can walk inside each house and the coffe shop.
The main thing in the project is the coffe shop wich is furniched with chairs, tables, sofas, lights, decorations, pictures, bars, shelfs and more.
It's my first Unity project and it's just for practicing:)
